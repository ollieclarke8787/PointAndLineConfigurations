## 3x4 grid example
The file "gridExample.m2" contains code for studying the ideal of the '3x4 grid'. Running this file will verbosely check the following:
1. A minimal set of generators of the prime component P2 from the paper [On the prime decomposition of some determinantal hyperedge ideal] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717119301348 is given by the polynomials G_(3,4)(c_1, (i,j,k,l,m,n)) where i <= j <= k <= l <= m <= n
2. The other G_(3,4) polynomials are contained inside P2.
